# Computation Methods in Evolution

This repository is about notes for Computation Methods in Evolution

The following parts would be added to the repository:

- My notes about phylogenetics and population genetic (mainly about the lectures by Prof. Dr. Dirk Metzler, ws24/25, LMU);
- Related code for some simple examples.

I will follow the framework of the lecture and try to improve a little bit of the organization, mathematic proof and examples.

Please let me know if you are also interested in this project:)
